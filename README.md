# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
AutosRUs' is reviewing the production data of the newest prototype for insights that may help the manufacturing team. The prototype is suffering from production troubles that are blocking the manufacturing team's progress.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
The data set is mpg test results for 50 prototype MechaCars.  The prototypes were produced using multiple design specifications to identify ideal vehicle performance.  A linear regression model was created to predict the mpg of the prototypes.
